In System Integration and Architecture, I’m really expecting to gain a deeper understanding of how different technologies, software, and hardware actually work together as one complete system. I believe this will help me see the bigger picture of how systems are designed, built, and connected to achieve certain goals. I’m genuinely excited to learn how integration makes processes easier, faster, and more seamless. I also expect this subject to help me improve my problem solving and critical thinking skills. Because I think system integration is about analyzing requirements and designing solutions that work across different platforms, I know it will push me to think both logically and creatively. I’m also hoping to gain more hands on experience, especially in connecting databases, applications, and networks, because I know these are very important in real world projects. And I see that this subject is a good preparation not just for academic success, but also for my future career in this field. Learning how systems are structured and integrated is very essential in today’s technology driven world. I’m looking forward to learning more, collaborating with my classmates, and applying what I gain from this subject in meaningful and practical ways.
